# Diet of Crows

Crows are omnivorous birds with a diverse diet that reflects their adaptability and intelligence. They are opportunistic feeders, taking advantage of available food sources in their environment.

## Common Food Sources
- **Insects**: Crows consume a variety of insects, including beetles, caterpillars, and grasshoppers, which provide essential protein.
- **Fruits and Nuts**: They enjoy fruits such as berries and cherries, as well as nuts like acorns and walnuts, often caching them for later use.
- **Human Food**: In urban areas, crows scavenge leftovers, garbage, and food scraps, demonstrating their ability to exploit human activities.
