# Intelligence of Crows

Crows are known for their exceptional problem-solving skills and ability to use tools. They can plan for future events and recognize human faces.

## Examples of Intelligence
- **Tool Use**: Crows have been observed using sticks to extract insects from tree bark.
- **Problem Solving**: Experiments show that crows can solve complex puzzles to access food, and evenunderstand complex ideas such as water displacement.[^1]
- **Generational learning**: Flocks of crows (called a murder) have demonstrated the ability to hold and even pass along grudges.[^2]
