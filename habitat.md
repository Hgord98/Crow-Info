# Habitat of Crows

Crows are highly adaptable birds found in a variety of habitats across the globe. They thrive in both urban and rural environments, showcasing their resiliance and adaptability.[1^]

## Types of Habitat
- **Urban Areas**: Crows often inhabit cities and towns, where they find ample food sources and nesting sites. They are known to forage in parks, garbage bins, and near human activity.
- **Forests**: In more natural settings, crows prefer open woodlands and mixed forests, where they can build nests in trees and find food among the foliage.
- **Grasslands and Fields**: They also frequent agricultural areas, scavenging for grains, insects, and small animals in open fields.
